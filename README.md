## Welcome to Cum Pages

Link to github.io page displaying the website: https://developers-guild.github.io/website/

Plan (from Mathieu):
- Core css/page format made with Bootstrap
- Server website/server hosted in node.js + express.js (not going to apply to github.io - only once we host it ourselves)
- If we need a database, mongoDb?
- Don't use jekyll

i was going to start working on it but actually im not really down and i have no idea what the contents really should be yet
